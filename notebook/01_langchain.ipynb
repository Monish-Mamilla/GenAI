Armstrong's famous words upon stepping onto the lunar surface were, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" He was followed by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited overhead in the Command Module, Columbia. This mission marked a significant milestone in space exploration and human achievement.\n"
